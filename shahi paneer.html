                            To prepare this creamy shahi paneer recipe, chop the onion, green chillies, tomatoes along with ginger and coriander leaves separately. Now in a bowl, add the curd and whisk it well. If you are in a hurry, you can also use tomato puree instead of chopped
                            tomatoes. To make this recipe more delicious, you can dry roast the spices separately and then add them to the gravy. This will make your recipe more aromatic. Now, grind cashews and almonds separately using a little water
                            and make cashew and almond paste. Keep them aside until required.

                            Next, put a pan on medium flame and heat 3 tbsps of ghee in it. Add the chopped onions, ginger, green chillies along with green cardamoms for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. Then, add
                            the beaten curd, cook for another 5 minutes and pour a cup of water into the pan. Cook for another 2 minutes. When the gravy is cooked, let it cool down at room temperature. When it's cool enough, add it to a mixer jar and
                            blend till smooth and keep aside.

                            for another 3 to 5 minutes. While the gravy is being cooked, cut the paneer into cubes and keep it aside till required. Take two cubes and grate them for garnishing.
